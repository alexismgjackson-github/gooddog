## WHY I BUILT THIS

I wanted to build a booking system of some sort. Ultimately, I decided to go with creating a dog grooming booking system after finding several beautiful images of dogs on the Unsplash site. Also, I am obsessed with dogs!

## WHAT I LEARNED

### _REACT ROUTER_

- Defining and nesting Route/Routes
- Rendering the selected current route with Outlet
- Setting the URL and tracking browsing history with Links
- Navigating the app after form successful submission via useNavigate

### _EXPORTING/IMPORTING DATA_

- Using named imports and setting type="module" in the script tag
- Using map to iterate over the array of objects

### _USESTATE_

- Form validation

### _USECONTEXT_

- Sharing form values between components without explicitly passing props
- Sharing radio input values between components without explicitly passing props

### _USEEFFECT_

- Scroll To Top of page for better user experience
- Clear form inputs of values when the user navigates
- Preventing the user from selecting a date before today's date in the date picker

### _RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN_

- Implementing media queries to add device breakpoints
- Using device breakpoints to change orientation, font size, etc
- Using CSS Position, Grid and Flexbox

### _ACCESSIBILITY_

- Calculating the contrast ratio of text, icons and background colors using Coolors' Color Contrast Checker
- Adding aria-labels and alt tags to buttons, icons, images, etc

## MOST CHALLENGING

- Form input's data persistence

## BUGS

- I have not found any bugs yet

## FUTURE UPDATES

- No future plans for right now
